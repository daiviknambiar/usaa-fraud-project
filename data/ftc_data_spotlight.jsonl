With romance scams that’s doubly true – hearts are broken and wallets are emptied. For three years running, people have reported losing more money on romance scams than on any other fraud type identified in Sentinel.<sup><a href=\"#end1\">1</a></sup>&nbsp;In 2020, reported losses to romance scams reached a record $304 million, up about 50% from 2019. For an individual, that meant a median dollar loss of $2,500. From 2016 to 2020, reported total dollar losses increased more than fourfold, and the number of reports nearly tripled.<sup><a href=\"#end2\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>It is reasonable to wonder: what happened in 2020 to make these dollars losses continue to spike? An obvious reason may be the pandemic limiting our ability to meet in person. But outside the pandemic, the share of people who have ever used an online dating site or app has also been rising.<sup><a href=\"#end3\">3</a></sup>&nbsp;And romance scammers are primed to take advantage. Scammers fabricate attractive online profiles to draw people in, often lifting pictures from the web and using made up names. Some go a step further and assume the identities of real people. Once they make online contact, they make up reasons not to meet in person. The pandemic has both made that easier and inspired new twists to their stories, with many people reporting that their so-called suitor claimed to be unable to travel because of the pandemic. Some scammers have reportedly even canceled first date plans due to a supposed positive COVID-19 test.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Romance Scam Reports Over Time\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u50873/romance_scam_2020.png\" style=\"height:400px; width:600px\"></p>\n\n<p>While many people report losing money on romance scams that start on dating apps, even more say they were targeted on social media.<sup><a href=\"#end4\">4</a></sup>&nbsp;These social media users aren’t always looking for love, and report that the scam often starts with an unexpected friend request or message.</p>\n\n<p>Sooner or later, these scammers always ask for money. They might say it’s for a phone card to keep chatting. Or they might claim it’s for a medical emergency, with COVID-19 often sprinkled into their tales of woe. The stories are endless, and can create a sense of urgency that pushes people to send money over and over again.</p>\n\n<p>What many of the largest reported dollar losses have in common is that people believe their new partner has actually sent <em>them</em> a large sum of money. Scammers claim to have sent money for a cooked-up reason, and then have a detailed story about why the money needs to be sent back to them or on to someone else. People think they’re helping someone they care about, but they may actually be laundering stolen funds. In fact, many reported that the money they received and forwarded on turned out to be stolen unemployment benefits.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, reports of gift cards being used to send money to romance scammers increased by nearly 70%. Gift cards, along with wire transfers, are the most frequently reported payment methods for romance scams.<sup><a href=\"#end5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;People said they mailed the gift cards or gave the card’s PIN number to the scammer. The median amount people sent romance scammers in 2020 using any method of payment was $2,500, more than ten times the median loss across all other fraud types.<sup><a href=\"#end6\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Reports of money lost on romance scams increased for every age group in 2020. People ages 20 to 29 saw the most striking increase, with the number of reports more than doubling since 2019. People ages 40 to 69 were once again the most likely to report losing money to romance scams.<sup><a href=\"#end7\">7</a></sup>&nbsp;And people 70 and older reported the highest individual median losses at $9,475.<sup><a href=\"#end8\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>So how can you play it safe while looking for love online? Here are some tips to help you steer clear of scammers:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Never send money or gifts to someone you haven’t met in person – even if they send you money first.</li>\n<li>Talk to someone you trust about this new love interest. It can be easy to miss things that don’t add up. So pay attention if your friends or family are concerned.</li>\n<li>Take it slowly. Ask questions and look for inconsistent answers.</li>\n<li>Try a reverse-image search of the profile pictures. If they’re associated with another name or with details that don’t match up, it’s a scam.</li>\n<li>Learn more at <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/romancescams\">ftc.gov/romancescams</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Help stop scammers by reporting suspicious profiles or messages to the dating app or social media platform. Then, tell the FTC at <a href=\"http://www.reportfraud.ftc.gov/\">ReportFraud.ftc.gov</a>.</p>\n\n<div class=\"WordSection1\">\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div>&nbsp;\n<hr>\n<p><small><a name=\"end1\"> </a>1 The analysis is based on self-reported data from consumers that is stored in the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Database. It is not a survey that measures prevalence of this particular scam. This analysis excludes fraud reports classified as “Other misc.”</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end2\"> </a>2 Losses sustained in these scams are reported by consumers but not independently verified. These figures and figures throughout this Spotlight are based on reports to the FTC's Consumer Sentinel Network that were classified as romance scams, excluding reports provided by the Internet Crimes Complaint Center (IC3). IC3 reports submitted prior to 2020 were unavailable at the time of publication, so these reports were excluded to ensure greater consistency in reporting trends over time. .</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end3\"> </a>3 According to the Pew Research Center, the “share of Americans who have used these platforms – as well as the share who have found a spouse or partner through them – has risen over time.” See Monica Anderson, Emily A. Vogels, and Erica Turner, Pew Research Center, The Virtues and Downsides of Online Dating (Feb. 2020, Rev. Jan. 2021), at 3, available at https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/02/06/the-virtues-and-downsides-of-online-dating/. </small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end4\"> </a>4 This finding is based on keyword analysis of 2020 Consumer Sentinel Reports classified as a romance scams and indicating a dollar loss. Of these, 2,276 reports mentioned the dating apps Ashley Madison, BLK, Bumble, Chispa, Coffee Meets Bagel, eharmony, EliteSingles, FriendFinder, Grindr, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, OurTime, Plenty of Fish, Seeking Arrangement, SilverSingles, Tinder, WooPlus, or Zoosk. Another 5,924 mentioned Facebook or Instagram. Reports that mentioned one of the specified dating apps and also Facebook or Instagram were excluded from the Facebook or Instagram figure. Because these numbers have not been normalized based on the number of users, they should not be understood as an indication that an individual user of Facebook or Instagram is more likely to encounter a romance scam as compared to users of these dating apps.</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end5\"> </a>5 Wire transfer refers to payments made by wire transfer services such as MoneyGram and Western Union. Gift cards include reload cards (e.g., MoneyPak)..</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end6\"> </a>6 Median loss calculations are based on reports indicating a monetary loss of $1 to $999,999. Reports provided by MoneyGram, Western Union, and Green Dot are excluded for this calculation as these data contributors report each transaction separately, which typically affects calculation of an individual’s median loss. The median individual reported loss for all frauds in 2020, excluding romance scams, was $240.</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end7\"> </a>7 In 2020, 62% of romance scam reports included in this Spotlight included age information. This age comparison is normalized based on the number of loss reports per million population by age during this period. Population numbers were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States (June 2020).</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end8\"> </a>8 See endnote 6.</small></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n      </div>\n</div>", "scraped_at": "2025-11-02T16:26:59Z", "source": "data-spotlight"}

Reports to the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel show they’re also an easy way to take. About one in four people who report losing money to fraud say it happened when a scammer tricked them into giving the numbers on the back of a gift card.<sup><a href=\"#end1\">1</a></sup> Gift cards are far more frequently reported than any other payment method for fraud,<sup><a href=\"#end2\">2</a></sup> and the numbers have reached staggering new highs compared to past years.<sup><a href=\"#end3\">3</a></sup> In the first nine months of 2021 alone, nearly 40,000 people reported $148 million stolen using gift cards. And because the vast majority of frauds are not reported to the government, this reflects only a fraction of the harm these scams cause.<sup><a href=\"#end4\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Scammers tell people to go to a specific store and buy a specific gift card.\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u251195/gc_spotlight_scammer_process_300.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:155px; margin-left:10px; width:300px\">Scammers favor gift cards because they are easy for people to find and buy, and they have fewer protections for buyers compared to some other payment options. Scammers can get quick cash, the transaction is largely irreversible, and they can remain anonymous.</p>\n\n<p>According to reports received by the FTC, scams demanding gift cards most often start with a phone call from someone impersonating a well-known business or government authority.<sup><a href=\"#end5\">5</a></sup> Many people report that a scammer posing as Amazon or Apple told them to send pictures of the numbers on gift cards to fix a supposed security problem with their account. Sometimes they call those numbers “security codes.” But the only thing the numbers are good for is taking the money on the card. Other people report that a scammer claiming to be the Social Security Administration said their bank accounts would be frozen as part of an investigation. They’re told to buy gift cards to avoid arrest or to secure access to their money. Reports also show that scammers asking for gift cards pretend to be a love interest, employer, sweepstakes or lottery company, or family member in trouble.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Top Gift Card Brands\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u251195/gc_spotlight_brand_losses_300.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:400px; margin-right:10px; width:300px\">Whatever the story, reports show that scammers don’t settle for just any card – they tell people the specific gift card brands to buy. In the first nine months of 2021, over twice as much money was reported lost on Target gift cards than any other brand. Google Play gift cards were next, followed by Apple, eBay, and Walmart cards.</p>\n\n<p>Scammers also tell people where to buy the gift cards. In the first nine months of 2021, people who reported losing money buying gift cards mentioned Target stores more than other retailers. Reports suggest that Walmart, Best Buy, CVS, and Walgreens stores are also popular with scammers.</p>\n\n<p>Scammers use lots of tricks to avoid detection. People often say the scammer sent them to several store locations to make multiple purchases. Scammers tell people to stay on the phone with the scammer the entire time – a trick to make sure they don’t call anyone who might help. Scammers even coach people on what to say if a cashier asks questions; they don’t want anyone to stop the scam, and they know store employees are often the only people who can help.</p>\n\n<p>Both the number of reported gift card scams and total losses have increased every year since 2018.<sup><a href=\"#end6\">6</a></sup> Losses are certainly up due to the higher number of reports, but individuals also report that they’re losing a lot more money. In fact, losses of $5,000 or more have increased from about 8% of reports in 2018 to about 14% in the first nine months of 2021. Over the same period, median reported losses increased from $700 to $1,000.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Reports of Gift Card Scams\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u251195/gc_spotlight_reports_600.jpg\" style=\"height:540px; margin-bottom:10px; margin-top:10px; width:600px\"></p>\n\n<p>Losses also vary by card brand. Target cards, for example, saw a median reported loss of $2,500 in the first nine months of the year, far higher than other frequently reported cards.<sup><a href=\"#end7\">7</a></sup> In addition, 30% of people who paid with a Target card said they lost $5,000 or more.<sup><a href=\"#end8\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Whenever someone demands to be paid with a gift card, that’s a scam. It’s just that simple. Gift cards are for gifts, not for payments. If someone convinced you to give them the numbers on a gift card or send them a photo, hang onto the card and your receipt, and report it to the card issuer <strong>right away</strong>.

Although it’s yet to become a mainstream payment method, reports to the FTC show it’s an alarmingly common method for scammers to get peoples’ money. Since the start of 2021, more than 46,000 people have reported losing over $1 billion in crypto to scams<sup><a href=\"#crypto1\">[1]</a></sup> – that’s about one out of every four dollars reported lost,<sup><a href=\"#crypto2\">[2]</a></sup> more than <i>any </i>other payment method. The median individual reported loss? A whopping $2,600. The top cryptocurrencies people said they used to pay scammers were Bitcoin (70%), Tether (10%), and Ether (9%).<sup><a href=\"#crypto3\">[3]</a></sup> &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Crypto has several features that are attractive to scammers, which may help to explain why the reported losses in 2021 were nearly <i>sixty times </i>what they were in 2018. There’s no bank or other centralized authority to flag suspicious transactions and attempt to stop fraud before it happens. Crypto transfers can’t be reversed – once the money’s gone, there’s no getting it back. And most people are still unfamiliar with how crypto works. These considerations are not unique to crypto transactions, but they all play into the hands of scammers.</p>\n\n<p>Reports point to social media and crypto as a combustible combination for fraud. Nearly half the people who reported losing crypto to a scam since 2021 said it started with an ad, post, or message on a social media platform.<sup><a href=\"#crypto4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n\n\n<article class=\"align-right media media--type-image media--view-mode-sm\">\n  \n      <div class=\"media__content\">\n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n          <div class=\"field__label usa-sr-only\">Image</div>\n        <div class=\"field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <img src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/styles/scaled_sm/public/ftc_gov/images/trend-viz.png?itok=IaZSNuP2\" width=\"500\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Reported Cryptocurrency Fraud Loss by year\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 500/900\">\n\n\n</div>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n\n    </div>\n  </article>\n\n\n<p>During this period, nearly four out of every ten dollars reported lost to a fraud originating on social media was lost in crypto, far more than any other payment method.<sup><a href=\"#crypto5\">[5]</a></sup> The top platforms identified in these reports were Instagram (32%), Facebook (26%), WhatsApp (9%), and Telegram (7%).<sup><a href=\"#crypto6\">[6]</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Of the reported crypto fraud losses that began on social media, most are <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/jobs-and-making-money/money-making-opportunities-and-investments\">investment scams</a>.<sup><a href=\"#crypto7\">[7]</a></sup> Indeed, since 2021, $575 million of all crypto fraud losses reported to the FTC were about bogus investment opportunities, far more than any other fraud type. The stories people share about these scams describe a perfect storm: false promises of easy money paired with people’s limited crypto understanding and experience. Investment scammers claim they can quickly and easily get huge returns for investors. But those crypto “investments” go straight to a scammer’s wallet. People report that investment websites and apps let them track the growth of their crypto, but it’s all fake. Some people report making a small “test” withdrawal – just enough to convince them it’s safe to go all in. When they really try to cash out, they’re told to send <i>more </i>crypto for (fake) fees, and they don’t get any of their money back.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-you-need-know-about-romance-scams\">Romance scams</a> are a distant second to investment scams, with $185 million in reported cryptocurrency losses since 2021 – that’s nearly one in every three dollars reported lost to a romance scam during this period.<sup><a href=\"#crypto8\">[8]</a></sup> And many have an investment twist too. These keyboard Casanovas reportedly dazzle people with their supposed wealth and sophistication. Before long, they casually offer tips on getting started with crypto investing and help with making investments. People who take them up on the offer report that what they really got was a tutorial on sending crypto to a scammer. The median individual reported crypto loss to romance scammers is an astounding $10,000.</p>\n\n<p><img align=\"left\" alt cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"5\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/ftc_gov/images/PSC-viz-crypto.png\"></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/features/imposter-scams\">Business and government impersonation scams</a> are next with $133 million in reported crypto losses since 2021. These scams can start with a text about a supposedly unauthorized Amazon purchase, or an alarming online pop-up made to look like a security alert from Microsoft. From there, people are reportedly told the fraud is extensive and their money is at risk. The scammers may even get the “bank” on the line to back up the story. (Pro tip: it’s not the bank.) In another twist, scammers impersonating border patrol agents have reportedly told people their accounts will be frozen as part of a drug trafficking investigation. These scammers tell people the only way to protect their money is to put it in crypto: people report that these “agents” direct them to take out cash and feed it into a crypto ATM. The “agent” then sends a QR code and says to hold it up to the ATM camera. But that QR code is embedded with the scammer’s wallet address.

That’s more than double the 2021 reported losses and nearly five times what people reported in 2019.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref2\" href=\"#_edn2\" title><sup>[2]</sup></a> In fact, reports about text scams spiked in the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic and have never returned to pre-pandemic levels.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref3\" href=\"#_edn3\" title><sup>[3]</sup></a></p><p>But why do they work? Scammers use the speed of text communication to their advantage: they hope you won’t slow down and think over what’s in the message. Some messages promise a good thing<em> – </em>a gift, a package, or even a job. Others try to make you panic, thinking someone’s in your accounts. These are all lies and ways to take your money and personal information.</p><p>While there are countless varieties of text scams, the top five described below account for over 40% of randomly sampled text frauds reported in 2022.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref4\" href=\"#_edn4\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><sup>[4]</sup></span></a> All five have one thing in common – they often work by impersonating well-known businesses.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref5\" href=\"#_edn5\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><sup>[5]</sup></span></a></p><h3><strong>1) Copycat bank fraud prevention alerts</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Wells-Fargo-Bank-Fraud-Alert.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Wells-Fargo-Bank-Fraud-Alert.png\" alt=\"Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Alert\" width=\"225\" height=\"90\"></a></p><p>Reports about texts impersonating banks are up nearly twentyfold since 2019.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref6\" href=\"#_edn6\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><sup>[6]</sup></span></a> You might get a fake number to call about supposed suspicious activity. Or they might say to reply “yes or no” to verify a large transaction (that you didn’t make). If you reply, you’ll get a call from the (fake) fraud department. People say they thought the bank was helping them get their money back. Instead, money was transferred <em>out</em> of their account. This scam’s median reported loss was a whopping $3,000 last year. Worse still, many people report giving their Social Security number and other personal information to scammers, leading to possible identity theft.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Amazon-Text-Scam.png\"><img class=\"text-align-center\" style=\"float:center;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Amazon-Text-Scam.png\" alt=\"Amazon Text Scam\" width=\"795\" height=\"300\"></a></p><h3><strong>2) Bogus “little gifts” that can cost you</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/ATT-Free-Msg.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/ATT-Free-Msg.png\" alt=\"Attention Message\" width=\"225\" height=\"100\"></a></p><p>A text about a free gift, reward, or prize may look like it came from a company you know – say, your cell phone company or a big retailer. But everything about this is fake. If you click the link and pay a small “shipping fee,” you just gave your credit card number to a scammer. Reports tell us fraudulent charges soon follow.</p><h3><strong>3) Fake package delivery problems</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/USPS-Mssg.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/USPS-Mssg.png\" alt=\"USPS Message\" width=\"245\" height=\"110\"></a></p><p>Expecting a package?

If you paid a small “redelivery fee,” which many people reported, that was a trick to get your credit card number. People also reported giving these scammers their personal information, including Social Security numbers.</p><h3><strong>4) Phony job offers</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Whole-Foods-Market.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Whole-Foods-Market.png\" alt=\"Whole Foods Market\" width=\"295\" height=\"120\"></a></p><p>Promises of easy money for mystery shopping at well-known stores like Whole Foods and Walmart are an old scammer favorite. Reports about bogus offers to make money driving around with your car wrapped in ads are also common.

In most of these reports, scammers use <a href=\"https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-spot-avoid-report-fake-check-scams\">checks that seem to “clear”</a> but turn out to be fake to trick people into sending them money.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref8\" href=\"#_edn8\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><sup>[8]</sup></span></a></p><h3><strong>5) Not-really-from-Amazon security alerts</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Transaction-Update.png\"><img style=\"float:right;margin:10px;\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Transaction-Update.png\" alt=\"Transaction Update\" width=\"225\" height=\"91\"></a></p><p>Like fake bank texts, texts from someone who says they’re “Amazon” look like automated fraud prevention messages. Often, they ask you to verify a big-ticket order you didn’t make. If you call the number in the text, you get a phony Amazon rep who offers to “fix” your account. People often report giving the rep remote access to their phone so they can get things fixed and get their refund.<a class=\"ck-anchor\" id=\"_ednref9\" href=\"#_edn9\" title><span class=\"MsoEndnoteReference\"><sup>[9]</sup></span></a> But then the rep says a couple of zeros were accidently added to the refund, so they need you to return that money to them – often by buying gift cards and giving the cards’ PIN numbers.</p><p>In all of these cases, reporting can help stop scam text messages:</p><ul><li>Forward it&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/consumer-resources/protecting-yourself-from-spam-text-messages\">7726 (SPAM)</a>.

For example, people who report investment scams most often say they “invested” with cryptocurrency or via bank transfer.<a href=\"#ftn7\" title><sup>[7]</sup></a> Reported payments to scammers by these two methods added up to the highest losses in 2023, both per person and in&nbsp;total.<a href=\"#ftn8\" title><sup>[8]</sup></a> And many people reported using payment apps and services, most often in connection with online shopping scams.<a href=\"#ftn9\" title><sup>[9]</sup></a> Most people who reported using a payment app or service named the company they used, with PayPal, Cash App, Zelle, Venmo, and Apple Pay most often reported in 2023.<br><br>Gift cards were the top reported payment method on several types of scams in 2023, including romance scams, tech support scams, government impersonation scams, and scams that impersonate people you know, like your boss or a grandchild. Reports show that scammers specify what gift card brand to buy, which most people named in their reports. In 2023, Apple cards were far and away the most reported gift card brand, followed by Target, eBay, Walmart and Amazon gift cards.<a href=\"#ftn10\" title><sup>[10]</sup></a></p><a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Data-Spotlightv2.png\">\n<article class=\"align-center media media--type-image media--view-mode-default\">\n  \n      <div class=\"media__content\">\n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n          <div class=\"field__label usa-sr-only\">Image</div>\n        <div class=\"field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/Data-Spotlightv2.png\"><img src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/styles/scaled_lg/private/ftc_gov/images/Data-Spotlightv2.png?itok=kTdQ-Fau\" width=\"940\" height=\"456\" alt=\"Nearly 9 out of 10 people who reported paying a scammer with a payment app or payment service named one of five top apps or services.

In 2024, people reported $470 million in losses to these scams, more than five times the 2020 number.<a href=\"#ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> And since the vast majority of frauds are never reported, this number likely reflects only a fraction of the actual harm.<a href=\"#ftn3\" title><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-default\">\n  \n      <div class=\"media__content\">\n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n          <div class=\"field__label usa-sr-only\">Image</div>\n        <div class=\"field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/trend-visual-new.png\"><img src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/styles/scaled_lg/private/ftc_gov/images/trend-visual-new.png?itok=hVUiRlr7\" width=\"960\" height=\"562\" alt=\"Visual Trend\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 960/562\">\n\n</a>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n\n    </div>\n  </article>\n<p>While there are countless varieties of text scams, the top five described below are estimated to account for about half of all text frauds reported to the FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network in 2024.<a href=\"#ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p><p>1) Fake package delivery problems</p><p>Messages about package deliveries, usually from someone pretending to be from the U.S. Postal Service, were the most reported text scam last year. These messages say there’s a problem with a delivery and link to a website that looks like the real USPS site – but isn’t. Many people reported paying a small “redelivery fee” that turned out to be a trick to get their credit card or even Social Security number.&nbsp;</p><p>2) Phony job opportunities</p><p>Scammers posing as recruiters to take people’s money isn’t new. But in 2024, reports of a new “task scam” took off.<a href=\"#ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> These scams often start with an unexpected text offering work without specifics. The “job” is to complete simple repetitive tasks like rating products or apps. But it’s all fake. At some point, people are told to send money to finish their tasks and withdraw their supposed earnings. But people who sent money said that they didn’t get it back.</p><p>3) Fake fraud alerts</p><p>Many people reported texts about so-called suspicious activity or a big purchase they didn’t make. These texts often look like they’re from a bank or Amazon. They might give a number to call. Or they might say to reply YES or NO to verify a large transaction. People who reply are connected to the (fake) fraud department for “help” fixing the made-up problem. These scammers quickly up the ante, often telling people all their money is at risk. The scammers then pressure people into moving money out of their accounts to supposedly keep it safe, but it really goes to the scammers. And people who move that money do not get any of it back.</p><p>4) Bogus notices about unpaid tolls</p><p>Scammers are sending texts that look like they’re from highway toll programs all over the country, from SunPass in Florida to FasTrak in San Francisco. These scammers tell people to click a link to pay an unpaid balance, but neither the charges nor the message are legit. Reports show these scammers are really after credit card and even Social Security numbers.</p><p>5) “Wrong number” texts that aren’t</p><p>Wrong number scams start with an out-of-the-blue message that looks innocent enough – it might just say “hello” or “do you want to get a coffee?” But a simple act of kindness – responding to let a stranger know they have the wrong number – can be the start of a very costly scam. Reports show these scammers strike up a fake friendship, often with romantic undertones. Next, they claim to be successful investors, offering to share their tricks and directing people to bogus investment platforms. People report losing all the money they “invest,” often tens of thousands of dollars.</p>\n<article class=\"media media--type-image media--view-mode-default\">\n  \n      <div class=\"media__content\">\n      \n  <div class=\"field field--name-field-media-image field--type-image field--label-visually_hidden\">\n          <div class=\"field__label usa-sr-only\">Image</div>\n        <div class=\"field__items\">\n              <div class=\"field__item\">  <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/images/top%20types.png\"><img src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/styles/scaled_lg/private/ftc_gov/images/top%20types.png?itok=oDXvdVDB\" width=\"960\" height=\"275\" alt=\"Top text scams\" loading=\"lazy\" typeof=\"foaf:Image\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 960/275\">\n\n</a>\n</div>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n\n    </div>\n  </article>\n<p>Here are some things you can do to help stop text scams:</p><ul><li>Forward messages&nbsp;to <a href=\"https://www.ctia.org/consumer-resources/protecting-yourself-from-spam-text-messages\">7726 (SPAM)</a>.

Car accident injuries, often broken noses, or uncontrolled sobbing explain away a voice that might not sound quite right. Scammers use personal details from social media sites to make their stories more believable. Or they may simply wait for their target to use a name – “Steve, is that you?” – and take the cue.</p><p>According to reports, callers often give very specific instructions about how to send cash. Many people said they were told to divide the bills into envelopes and place them between the pages of a magazine. Then, according to reports, they were told to send them using various carriers, including UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service.</p><p>What can you do about these scams? Talk about them. Many people have gotten these calls, so help others know what to do to spot and avoid the scam:</p><ul style=\"list-style-type:disc\" type=\"disc\"><li>Don’t act right away, no matter how dramatic the story is.</li><li>Call that family member or friend, and make sure you use a phone number that you know is right. Or check it out with someone else in your circle, even if the caller told you to keep it a secret.</li><li>Be careful about what you post on social media.

People in their 20s and 30s, a cohort that roughly tracks the so-called Millennial generation, are 25% <em>more likely</em> to report losing money to fraud than people 40 and over generally,<sup><a href=\"#end1\">1</a></sup> and <em>much more likely</em> to report a loss on certain types of fraud.</p>\n\n<p>The top five frauds to which Millennials report losing money are online shopping frauds, business imposters, government imposters, fake check scams, and romance scams. People 40+ report those same scams, too, but the data suggest that, with the exception of romance scams, Millennials may be less likely to avoid them or may encounter them more often. For example, Millennials are twice as likely as people 40+ to report losing money while shopping online. Frequently, shopping-related reports to the FTC are about items that are never delivered or aren’t as advertised. Millennials are also more likely than their older counterparts to report fraud losses on scams that promise to fix debt-related problems or that promise money through jobs, investments, or business opportunities.<sup><a href=\"#end2\">2</a></sup> Millennials are 93% more likely than people 40+ to report losing money to fake check scams, which also often look like a way to earn money.<sup><a href=\"#end3\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"Loss Reports by Millennials: Top 10 Frauds - Millennials are more likely than other generations to report losing money on many frauds, but less likely on other frauds.

The median individual amount Millennials report losing to fraud is $400, much lower than what people 40+ report.<sup><a href=\"#end4\">4</a></sup> But those individual losses add up: Millennials have reported losing nearly $450 million to fraud in just the past two years.<sup><a href=\"#end5\">5</a></sup> Of that, online shopping accounted for $71 million in reported losses, and government imposter scams were close behind, with $61 million in reported losses.</p>\n\n<p>The likelihood of reporting a loss varies by how people are first contacted by a scammer, and there are age differences here, too. While phone calls are the top contact method reported for people of all ages, Millennials report losing money to phone scams at slightly lower rates than people 40+. But Millennials are <em>more likely</em> to report losing money to frauds that start in other ways<sup><a href=\"#end6\">6</a></sup> —most notably, Millennials are 77% more likely than their older counterparts to say they lost money to a scam that started with an email.</p>\n\n<p>The most important takeaway: fraud affects <em>every</em> generation. If someone has contacted you to demand money or your personal information – stop. Talk to someone you trust. And check out the request.</p>\n\n<p>Here are some resources to help you navigate some of the scams hitting Millennials the hardest:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Tips for online shopping: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/onlineshopping\">ftc.gov/onlineshopping</a></li>\n\t<li>Watch out for bogus income offers: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/jobs\">ftc.gov/jobs</a></li>\n\t<li>Protect yourself from debt and credit scams: <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/debt\">ftc.gov/debt</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you spot a scam, report it to the FTC at <a href=\"https://ftc.gov/complaint\">ftc.gov/complaint</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n<p><small><a name=\"end1\" title> </a>1 From September 2017 through August 2019, people 20–39 filed fraud reports indicating that they lost money (“loss reports”) at a rate 25% higher than than people 40 and over. 47% of Sentinel fraud reports included usable age information during this period. The age comparison is normalized, based on the number of loss reports per million population by age. Population numbers used in this Spotlight were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau <em>Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Selected Age Groups by Sex for the United States, States, Counties and Puerto Rico Commonwealth and Municipios</em> (June 2019).</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end2\" title> </a>2 Based on a comparison of reporting rates by people 20–39 and people 40 and over on the following fraud types from September 2017 through August 2019 (percent difference in loss reporting rates as compared to people 40 and over noted in parentheses): advance-fee loans\\credit arrangers (+34%), credit repair (+85%), debt management\\credit counseling (+86%), business opportunities\\work-at-home-plans (+42%), employment agencies\\job counseling\\overseas work (+380%), investment (+48%), and multi-level marketing\\pyramids\\chain letters (+90%). Age comparisons based on loss reports per million population by age</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end3\" title> </a>3 People are often told to deposit a check and keep some of the money as payment for a phony offer to earn income. Using various ruses, scammers then direct people to send some of the money back to them. For example, people may believe they are buying equipment or supplies for an internship or sales job. Many people have reported using some of the money to send wire transfers or buy gift cards at a store they believed they were evaluating as a secret shopper. Once the bank identifies the check as a fake, the consumer may be responsible for any funds sent. These scams take advantage of unfamiliarity with how banks process checks and the terminology used. Banks are required to make check deposit funds available quickly, and consumer may even be told the check has “cleared.” However, it can take weeks for banks to identify a check as fraudulent.</small></p>\n\n<p><small><a name=\"end4\" title> </a>4 Median individual reported losses increase with age as follows: $500 for people 40-59, $640 for people 60-79. and $1,700 for people 80 and older.

Scammers <em>do</em> know, and they trick people into sending them money before the bank spots the fake. The FTC’s Consumer Sentinel Network database shows that people reported more than 27,000 fake check scams in 2019, with reported losses topping $28 million dollars.<sup><a href=\"#end1\">1</a></sup> And the data suggest that fake check scams disproportionately harm young adults – especially people in their twenties.</p>\n\n<p>Scammers have various fake check storylines, and job and income opportunities top the list. Last year, about 50% of people who reported a fake check scam to the FTC said they were offered a job or some other way to earn money.<sup><a href=\"#end2\">2</a></sup> Nearly half of those were fake mystery shopping jobs, and many others were phony <em>car</em>-<em>wrap advertising opportunities.</em> In another 18% of the reports, people said they got a fake check as payment for something they were selling online.</p>\n\n<p>Fake check scams have two telltale elements – a check to deposit and a plausible explanation for why you can’t keep all the money. The checks come in many varieties: a business or personal check, a cashier’s check, money order, or even a check delivered electronically. The ploys to get you to send back some of the money also vary. Potential mystery shoppers are told to use some of the money to “evaluate” a retailer by buying gift cards or money orders, or by wiring money through MoneyGram or Western Union. (The scammers make sure to get the gift card PIN number from you, or delay you from canceling the money order.) People who apply online and are hired as “personal assistants” are told to use the money to buy gift cards for the new boss (and, again, to give up those PIN numbers). People interested in car wrap advertising are told to send money to supposed decal installers – who never materialize. People buying something from you online “accidently” send a check for too much and ask you to refund the balance.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"Scammers tell lots of stories to trick people to send money back after depositing a fake check, including mystery shopping, online selling, loans, personal assistant, other jobs, car wrapping, winnings and grants and other stories.\" src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u251195/fake_check_stories.png\" style=\"height:auto; margin:0 auto; max-width:800px; width:100%\"></p>\n\n<p>These scams work because, once you deposit a check, you quickly see the funds in your account. Parting with some of that money then feels risk-free. But scammers know that while the law says banks have to make funds from deposited checks available within a day or two, it can take weeks to uncover a fake. Some scammers even tell you to wait for the check to “clear” before sending money. When it ultimately bounces, the bank can take back the amount of the fake check, leaving you on the hook for the money.</p>\n\n<div style=\"border-bottom:5px solid #5d99d5; border-top:5px solid #5d99d5; float:right; font-size:1.15rem; margin-bottom:10px; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px; margin-top:10px; padding:10px 0; width:33%\">Say you deposited a check for $1,000 and sent $600. A while later, the bank finds out the check was fake. It withdraws the full $1,000 from your account. Now, you’re out $600. If you didn’t have money in your account to cover that loss, you also have a negative balance.</div>\n\n<p>The number of reports made directly to the FTC about fake checks are on the rise – they’re up by about 65% over 2015 levels.<sup><a href=\"#end3\">3</a></sup> What’s more, no other fraud among last year’s top ten most frequently reported scams came close to the individual losses people reported on fake check scam last year.<sup><a href=\"#end4\">4</a></sup> The median individual loss reported on fake checks was $1,988, compared to $320 on all fraud types combined. And people reported that the scammers often asked to be paid by gift card or wire transfer. Con artists favor these payment methods because once the money is sent, it is almost impossible to trace or reverse.</p>\n\n<p>Younger people are hit especially hard. Last year, people in their twenties were more than twice as likely as people 30 and older to report losing money on a fake check scam.<sup><a href=\"#end5\">5</a></sup> Many college students have reported that the scam started with a message sent to their student email address. Scammers make these emails seem official – they may even impersonate the school’s career services office.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid these scams, here are a few things to know:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>If someone sends you a check and tells you to send money – whether by wiring money or buying gift cards – you can bet it’s a scam.</li>\n\t<li>Even if you see the money in your account, the bank can still take it back if the check later bounces. If you don’t know the person who wrote the check, don’t send money. Period.</li>\n\t<li>If you’re selling online, never accept a check for more than your asking price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To learn more about what to do if you have already sent money to a scammer, visit ftc.gov/fakechecks.

Economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may have created ideal conditions for these scams to proliferate. In fact, the volume of reports to the FTC about income scams reached the highest levels on record in the second quarter of 2020.<sup><a href=\"#end1\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>These income scams take many forms. Looming large are phony job offers involving fake checks. Schemes that promise to teach you insider secrets to start your own business are part of the mix, too, as are investment scams promising high returns. Chain letters and pyramid schemes are also popping up. People have reported losing about $610 million from income scams since 2016, with nearly $150 million reported lost in the first nine months of 2020 alone.</p>\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:center\"><span><span><img alt src=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/u50873/income_scams20_spotlight.jpg\" style=\"height:456px; width:600px\"></span></span></p>\n\n<p>Roughly one in three income scam reports is about phony job offers with a fake check as part of the ruse. Sometimes these scams start with an unexpected email about a job. For example, some c<span>ollege students have reported getting messages from someone impersonating their school’s career services office. Other people have reported that the</span> scam started after they applied for a job or posted a resume online. After a speedy hiring process, people get a supposed paycheck to deposit. But there’s always a plausible explanation for why they can’t keep all the money. Scammers tell people hired as “mystery shoppers” to buy gift cards as they evaluate a retailer (the scammers get the gift card PIN numbers, of course). People hired as “virtual personal assistants” are told to send some of the money to a supposed supplier of home office equipment. Other people have even reported that their so-called boss told them to use some of the funds to buy gift cards for co-workers sick with COVID-19.</p>\n\n<p>These scams work because banks have to make funds from deposited checks available within a day or two, but it can take weeks to uncover a fake. When you see the funds in your account, parting with some of the money may feel risk-free. But when the fake check ultimately bounces, the bank will want you to pay back the funds. The median reported loss on fake check job scams is $2,300<sup><a href=\"#end2\">2</a></sup>,&nbsp;and adults in their 20s are more than three times as likely to report a loss on a fake check job scam than other age groups.<sup><a href=\"#end3\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Another common tactic income scams use is making false claims about likely earnings from starting your own business. Business opportunity scammers promise attractive incomes to trick entrepreneurial people into buying bogus marketing services, training, or coaching programs. But despite testimonials that flaunt lavish lifestyles, their “proven systems” just don’t work. People have reported that some scammers are even invoking the pandemic as part of their pitch in offering work-at-home “opportunities.” But these opportunities frequently add up to huge losses. In fact, the median individual loss people report on business and work-at-home opportunities is $3,000, and for people in their 60s and 70s, the reported median loss is four times higher.<sup><a href=\"#end4\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Drumming up interest in investments is another lucrative tactic scammers deploy. Many investment seminar cons work by promising to teach people how to earn high returns on things like trading online or investing in real estate. But people report <em>losing </em>more on these scams than on any other fraud: the reported median individual loss is over $16,000. People in their 50s and 60s are more likely than other age groups to report losing money on these cons,<sup><a href=\"#end5\">5</a></sup>&nbsp;and their reported median individual losses are nearly $24,000.</p>\n\n<p>Some income scams put people to work as unwitting accomplices in another scam, costing people their time and effort. People report being hired on a 30-day probationary period, with titles like “logistics manager.” The scammers tell them their job is to receive and reship packages. What they don’t know is that they’re reshipping items bought with stolen credit cards. And after their probationary period ends, the scammers simply cut off communication without ever paying the person.</p>\n\n<p>Another variety is the pyramid scam. That old scam got new life by using novel names, like “blessing looms,” “circle games,” and “sou-sous.” A sou-sou is a collective savings club with historic roots in West Africa and the Caribbean. In a real sou-sou, money is rotated within a family or close-knit group, and everyone gets back what they contribute. Fake sou-sous, on the other hand, are pyramid schemes or chain letters. Like so-called blessing looms, they claim you’ll multiply the money you put in. But unlike a real sou-sou, payouts depend on recruiting new members – like family and friends. People typically lose all the money they invest.</p>\n\n<p>While reports of fake sou-sous by any name are still relatively low, they increased sharply starting in the second quarter of 2020<sup><a href=\"#end6\">6</a></sup>,and nearly 40% of people who reported said they heard about the supposed opportunity on social media.<sup><a href=\"#end7\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>It is clear that income scams take many different forms, but they share some tell-tale signs. Keep these tips in mind to avoid income scams:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Take your time. Avoid high-pressure sales pitches that require you to get involved now or risk losing out.</li>\n<li>Be skeptical about “success stories” and testimonials. Glowing stories could be fake and online reviews may have come from made-up profiles.</li>\n<li>Don’t bank on a “cleared” check. If you’re told to send some of the money or buy gift cards, you can bet it’s a fake even if you see the money in your account.</li>\n<li>Do your research. Search online for the company’s name plus words like review, scam, or complaint.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><span><span><span>To learn more, visit <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/incomescams\">ftc.gov/incomescams</a>.
