That’s a scam.\nReport it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov\n1. Scammers PRETEND to be from an organization you know.\nScammers often pretend to be contacting you on behalf of the government. They might use a real name, like the FTC, Social Security Administration, IRS, or Medicare , or make up a name that sounds official. Some pretend to be from a business you know, like a utility company , a tech company , or even a charity asking for donations.\nThey use technology to change the phone number that appears on your caller ID. So the name and number you see might not be real.\n2. Scammers say there’s a PROBLEM or a PRIZE.\nThey might say you’re in trouble with the government . Or you owe money . Or someone in your family had an emergency . Or that there’s a virus on your computer .\nSome scammers say there’s a problem with one of your accounts and that you need to verify some information.\nOthers will lie and say you won money in a lottery or sweepstakes but have to pay a fee to get it.\n3. Scammers PRESSURE you to act immediately.\nScammers want you to act before you have time to think. If you’re on the phone , they might tell you not to hang up so you can’t check out their story.\nThey might threaten to arrest you, sue you, take away your driver’s or business license, or deport you. They might say your computer is about to be corrupted.\n4. Scammers tell you to PAY in a specific way.\nThey often insist that you can only pay by using cryptocurrency , wiring money through a company like MoneyGram or Western Union, using a payment app , or putting money on a gift card and then giving them the numbers on the back of the card.\nSome will send you a check (that will later turn out to be fake), then tell you to deposit it and send them money.\nBlock unwanted calls and text messages. Take steps to block unwanted calls and to filter unwanted text messages .\nDon’t give your personal or financial information in response to a request that you didn’t expect. Honest organizations won’t call, email, or text to ask for your personal information, like your Social Security, bank account, or credit card numbers.\nIf you get an email or text message from a company you do business with and you think it’s real, it’s still best not to click on any links. Instead, contact them using a website you know is trustworthy. Or look up their phone number. Don’t call a number they gave you or the number from your caller ID.\nResist the pressure to act immediately. Honest businesses will give you time to make a decision. Anyone who pressures you to pay or give them your personal information is a scammer.\nKnow how scammers tell you to pay. Never pay someone who insists that you can only pay with cryptocurrency , a wire transfer service like Western Union or MoneyGram, a payment app , or a gift card . And never deposit a check and send money back to someone.\nStop and talk to someone you trust. Before you do anything else, tell someone — a friend, a family member, a neighbor — what happened.

So, how can you cut down on the number of unwanted telemarketing calls you get?\nIf you share your info with websites offering coupons, sweepstakes, or quotes for products like insurance or warranties, the site owners might collect and sell it to different telemarketers. That’s when the calls start from telemarketers — making calls you never agreed to receive and selling products you didn’t ask for.

That’s a scam.\nReport it at ReportFraud.ftc.gov\nTech support scammers use different tactics to trick you into believing there’s a virus or other issue with your computer.\nTech support scams often start with a bogus warning about a problem with your computer. It could be a fake pop-up warning that looks like it’s from a well-known company and urges you to call a phone number to get help. Other tech support scams might start with a call or text message from a scammer who pretends they’re a computer technician from a well-known company.\n[Listen to an FTC undercover call with a tech support scammer .]\nTech support scammers might also try to get their websites to show up in online search results for tech support or run their own display ads online.

They claim to find a malicious program and offer to remove it for a fee.\nThey often insist that you pay with gift cards, a wire transfer, a bank transfer, cryptocurrency, or a payment app. They want you to pay in one of these ways because it’s like using cash — once you pay, it’s hard to get your money back.\nSometimes, the fake tech support specialist with remote access to your computer pretends to scan it for viruses and claims to discover that someone hacked your accounts. Or that your name is linked to serious crimes, like money laundering or drug trafficking.\nThat’s when the tech support impersonator transfers you to someone who supposedly works for the government and can help you.

You might get an email or text message that says you were charged hundreds of dollars to renew your tech support subscription. To get your attention, the scammers use the names of well-known companies like Geek Squad, McAfee, and Norton.\nThe message says you must call a phone number within 24 hours if you want to dispute the charge.

After you do that, they claim there was an error in the amount entered. They say they refunded you too much money and insist you pay them back with gift cards, a wire transfer, a bank transfer, cryptocurrency, or a payment app.\nIf you get a message about a tech support subscription renewal and you think it’s real, contact the company directly using a phone number you know is real. Do not use the number included in the message.\nAlso check your credit card or bank account for an unauthorized transaction for a tech support subscription. If you see one, report it to your credit card company or bank and ask them to reverse it and give you back your money. If you don’t see a transaction for a tech support subscription, that tells you the message was a scam.

The organizer might ask for small contributions — $10, $50, $100 — which can quickly add up to thousands of dollars in funding.

Companies like eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Lyft, and others have online fundraising platforms their members can use.\nWhen you donate through an online fundraising platform, your money may not go directly to the charity you chose.

{"title": "No, that’s not an FTC commissioner on the phone", "url": "https://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-alerts/2025/09/no-thats-not-ftc-commissioner-phone", "published": "2025-11-25T09:00:00Z", "body": "Scammers like to pretend to be someone official to try to get your money. And who could be more official than the FTC chairman and commissioners, some of the nation’s leading fraud fighters? But here’s something important to know: nobody who works at the FTC will ever, EVER tell you to move your money to protect it. We won’t insist that you cash out your 401(k) or savings account and give that money to someone else.\nBut every week, the FTC gets reports from panicked people who wound up on the phone with “someone from the FTC” who told them just that. And then told them to keep it a secret. All with the goal of stealing as much money as they possibly could.\nSo spread the word: FTC staff won’t ever tell you to move or give someone your money, for any reason. Not Chairman Andrew Ferguson. Not Commissioner Melissa Holyoak. Not Commissioner Mark Meador.\nWatch this video, the first in a series from all the commissioners, so they can tell you for themselves — and then please share it.

Scammers do, too, and they’re impersonating the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to steal your money. Here’s how the scam works.\nYou get an “urgent” call, text, or email that looks like it’s from the USPTO. It may even use the name of a real USPTO employee, like a trademark examining attorney. They say you need to pay by phone — or by clicking a link in the text or email — to complete your application before someone else registers the same trademark. Or they say your trademark was just approved or needs renewal and to pay them immediately. They might say to pay with a credit or debit card, or with a wire transfer , payment app , or gift card . But in any of those cases, it’s not actually the USPTO reaching out. It’s a scammer who tried to look real by faking caller ID, using the name of a real USPTO employee, or using an official-looking USPTO seal.\nTo help you avoid a scam like this:\nLearn more about government impersonation scams at ftc.gov/imposters .
